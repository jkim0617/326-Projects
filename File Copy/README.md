This is a program intended to copy data from one text file to another. The program is written 
in C and should be compiled using the command "gcc fileCopy.c -o fileCopy" in the terminal. 
After a successful compilation, run the command "./fileCopy <source file> <destination file>"
with the source file ALWAYS being the first argument followed with the destination file. 
An example of the proper syntax looks like: "./fileCopy input.txt copy.txt". The source 
and destination files do not need to be named input and copy for the program to run properly.
